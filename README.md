# Runoff Rampage: Preventing Agri-Based Pollution in the Shannon Basin

## Background Context

Ireland's freshwater ecosystems are under severe pressure, with nearly half (46%) of Irish rivers failing to meet ecological health standards according to the EPA's 2022 assessment. Agricultural runoff is one of the leading causes, introducing excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, animal slurry, manure, and silage effluent into waterways. These nutrients often travel overland during heavy rainfall, especially on saturated or heavy soils, fueling excessive plant and algal growth. This leads to oxygen depletion, biodiversity loss, clogged waterways, and ecosystem damage. Additionally, hazardous chemicals from pesticides and animal health products wash into rivers via runoff, contaminating drinking water with bacteria, parasites, and viruses—a risk amplified by climate change's increasing rainfall intensity and frequency.

This challenge is particularly critical in the Shannon River Basin, Ireland's largest river system, which serves as a vital living laboratory for environmental, social, and economic activities. Spanning over 70% farmland—predominantly livestock grazing on pasture—the basin is central to water supply, biodiversity, agriculture, tourism, and cultural heritage. Traditional approaches often address water quality after contamination occurs, but preventing pollution at the source is now a top environmental priority. By leveraging space-enabled technologies, such as NASA Earth observation data and satellite imagery, innovative solutions can predict and mitigate runoff risks, protecting this essential resource and providing a blueprint for global water protection in similar systems like the Mississippi or Mekong River Basins.

## Problem Framing
Problem Framing
How can space-enabled technologies, including satellite imagery, weather prediction models, and geospatial analysis, be used to map high-risk farmlands bordering the Shannon River that are susceptible to runoff pollution, and develop a proactive information system that alerts farmers and land managers to impending heavy rainfall to prevent agricultural contaminants from entering waterways?

## Expected Outcomes

- A web or mobile app that integrates weather APIs, satellite data, and topographic information to visualize high-risk runoff zones and forecast conditions likely to trigger pollution events.
- An early-warning system delivering real-time notifications (e.g., via SMS, email, or dashboard alerts) to farmers, advising them to delay fertilizer, pesticide, or manure spreading ahead of risky weather.
- A machine learning model trained on historical weather patterns, soil moisture data, land cover maps, and satellite imagery to predict and prioritize hotspot locations for runoff risk.
- Educational visualizations, guidelines, and decision-support tools for farmers on best practices for timing agricultural activities to minimize pollution, including interactive maps of vulnerable areas near waterways.

## Difficulty
**Intermediate – Advanced**

## Scope

### Included:

- Weather monitoring and forecasting using APIs, meteorological data, and satellite imagery.
- Development of AI/ML models for runoff risk prediction and geospatial analysis.
- Creation of early-warning and alert systems for proactive communication.
- Data visualization, public sharing platforms, and app or website development.
- Integration of space-enabled tools like NASA Earth observation data for mapping and analysis.

### Excluded:

- Direct soil or water quality sampling and on-site monitoring.
- Design or implementation of physical infrastructure for runoff prevention (e.g., barriers, drainage systems, or erosion controls).
- In-depth investigation or development of alternative farming methods, policy reforms, or cleaner agricultural practices.

## Inspiration
Draw inspiration from NASA's Space Apps Challenges focused on water resource management and climate resilience, such as those using Earth observation data (e.g., Landsat or MODIS satellites) for agricultural monitoring and flood prediction. Explore the EU's Copernicus program for satellite-based environmental monitoring examples, including runoff modeling in European river basins. Global initiatives like the USDA's Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) or similar predictive systems in the Great Lakes region can provide transferable ideas for proactive pollution prevention adaptable to other contexts worldwide.
